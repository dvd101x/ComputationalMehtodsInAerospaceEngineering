# Computational Methods In Aerospace Engineering

This course is no longer available on [MIT Open Course Ware](https://ocw.mit.edu/)

There is still an archived version at [https://dspace.mit.edu](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/143656/16-90-spring-2014/contents/?sequence=9&isAllowed=y) but I'm concerned it will no longer be available.

This repository will include the three units as readme files including math equations just in case.
